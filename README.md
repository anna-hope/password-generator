## password generator

A CLI passphrase generator that uses the [Diceware™](https://theworld.com/~reinhold/diceware.html) wordlist, written in Rust.

Sample output:
```
Your passphrase is: sail-lilly-mabel-small-heavy
Copied to clipboard! ✅
```

### Motivation

This is mostly a small project for me to learn Rust. However, if you find it useful, you can install it using the steps below. 

### Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:anna-hope/password-generator.git
cd passsword-generator
cargo install --path .
```
